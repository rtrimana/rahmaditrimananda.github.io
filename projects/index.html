		<ul>
			<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
			<li><strong>Graduate Student Researcher <em>(2015-2020) – University of California, Irvine</em>:</strong> Working on research projects that focus on software infrastructure, systems, and compiler development for smart home devices, mobile, and cloud applications programmability, security, privacy and safety; working in both software and hardware sides of IoT devices.</li>
			<li><strong>Software Engineering Intern <em>(Summer 2017) – Xilinx Corp., San Jose</em>:</strong> Conducted research on the Xilinx FPGA tool-chain and developed a prototype of FPGA cutting edge debugging features. Developed cutting edge debugging features using compiler techniques in newly being developed SDx tool chain. This is meant to allow application developers with little or no FPGA expertise to use high level programming languages such as OpenCL, C and C++ to program FPGAs.</li>
			<li><strong>RTL/System Programmer at Megaframe Project <em>(2008-2009) – TU Delft, Netherlands</em>:</strong> Worked on <a href="http://www.megaframe.eu/" target="_blank">Megaframe project</a> for master’s final project in Delft Technological University with Prof. Edoardo Charbon. This project was a research initiative in low-cost techniques for single photon counting that involves a consortium of top European research universities and institutes, e.g. EPFL, University of Edinburgh, Delft University of Technology, and ST Microelectronics.</li>
			<li><strong>Graduate Intern Researcher <em>(Summer 2008) – TNO, Delft, Netherlands</em>:</strong> A short research internship program that was conducted in TNO, a Dutch research company. The research was about optimizing power management of wireless sensor network as a low-power embedded system.</li>
      <li><strong>Junior Lecturer and Researcher <em>(2009-2011) – University of Pelita Harapan, Jakarta, Indonesia</em>:</strong> Taught students and conducted small-scale research (built a complete automation software/hardware system for garment printing using <a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Gutenprint</a>).
			<li><strong>Parallel Microcontroller <em>(2005-2006) – University of Pelita Harapan, Jakarta, Indonesia</em>:</strong> Developed a prototype of parallel processors with microcontrollers. The system consists of up to four configurable microcontrollers that communicate with one another in a master-slave hierarchy. The project involves designing algorithms for parallelizing tasks, communication between processing nodes, result aggregation, and interfacing with outside world.
