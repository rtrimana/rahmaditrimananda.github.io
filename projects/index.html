	<h2>Select Projects</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Smart Home Devices Programmability, Security, Privacy, and Safety <em>(2015-2020) – University of California, Irvine</em>:</strong> Research projects that focus on software infrastructure, systems, and compiler development for smart home devices, mobile, and cloud applications programmability, security, privacy and safety; working in both software and hardware sides of IoT devices.</li>
			<li><strong>FPGA Cutting-edge Debugging Feature <em>(Summer 2017) – Xilinx Corp., San Jose</em>:</strong> Research on the Xilinx FPGA tool-chain and developed a prototype of FPGA cutting edge debugging features. Developed cutting edge debugging features using compiler techniques in newly being developed SDx tool chain. This is meant to allow application developers with little or no FPGA expertise to use high level programming languages such as OpenCL, C and C++ to program FPGAs.</li>
			<li><strong>Garment printing system <em>(2009-2011) – University of Pelita Harapan, Jakarta, Indonesia</em>:</strong> Implemented complete automation software/hardware system for garment printing using <a href="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Gutenprint</a>. Please read this <a href="http://repository.petra.ac.id/15699/1/Proceeding_Final.pdf#page=233" target="_blank">paper</a> for more information.</li>
			<li><strong>Megaframe Project <em>(2008-2009) – TU Delft, Netherlands</em>:</strong> Designed and implemented data collection infrastructure for SPAD (Single Photon Avalanche Diode) array in the <a href="http://www.megaframe.eu/" target="_blank">Megaframe project</a> for master’s final project in Delft Technological University with Prof. Edoardo Charbon. This project was a research initiative in low-cost techniques for single photon counting that involves a consortium of top European research universities and institutes, e.g. EPFL, University of Edinburgh, Delft University of Technology, and ST Microelectronics. Please see this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6176268/" target="_blank">paper</a> and this <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7780/77801H/High-frame-rate-TCSPC-FLIM-using-a-novel-SPAD-based/10.1117/12.860769.full?SSO=1&tab=ArticleLink" target="_blank">paper</a> for more information.</li>
			<li><strong>Low-power Wireless Sensor Network <em>(Summer 2008) – TNO, Delft, Netherlands</em>:</strong> Optimizing power management of wireless sensor network as a low-power embedded system.</li>
			<li><strong>Parallel Microcontroller <em>(2005-2006) – University of Pelita Harapan, Jakarta, Indonesia</em>:</strong> Developed a prototype of parallel processors with microcontrollers. The system consists of up to four configurable microcontrollers that communicate with one another in a master-slave hierarchy. The project involves designing algorithms for parallelizing tasks, communication between processing nodes, result aggregation, and interfacing with outside world.
